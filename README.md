Introducing the Monthly Training Weight Calculator for Jim Wendler's 531 Program:

Version 1: This script outputs the Jim Wendler's 531 program directly in the terminal for 20 seconds, providing users with their monthly training weights without any additional features.

Version 2: In this version, the script allows users to input their username and generates the program as a text file in the directory where the script is executed. This provides users with a convenient way to save and access their training plan. There are also "tm" and "back" options added. "tm" calculates the training max using the formula Jim uses in his program: n_reps * weight_lifted * 0.0333 + weight_lifted)*0.9. "back" is used to rewrite the exercise or traning max in case of a mistake.

Version 3: For added convenience and organization, Version 3 of the script not only incorporates username input but also creates a dedicated "Gym" folder on the desktop if it doesn't already exist. The program is then generated and saved within this folder, ensuring easy access and tidy storage of the training plan.

Version 4: ADD MORE FOOLPROOFING!
