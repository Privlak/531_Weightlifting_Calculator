Introducing the **Monthly Training Weight Calculator** for **Jim Wendler's 531 Program**: <br>

<br>

**Version 1:**

This script outputs the Jim Wendler's 531 program directly in the terminal for 20 seconds, providing users with their monthly training weights without any additional features.

<br>

**Version 2:**

In this version, the script allows users to input their username and generates the program as a text file in the directory where the script is executed. This provides users with a convenient way to save and access their training plan. 

There are also "tm" and "back" options added.

<br>

"tm" calculates the training max using the formula Jim uses in his program: (n_reps * weight_lifted * 0.0333 + weight_lifted)*0.9 

Bear in mind that it currently uses 90% of the training max, some might prefer lower/higher percentage!

<br>

"back" is used to rewrite the exercise or training max in case of a mistake. Not fully polished.

<br>

**Version 3:**

For added convenience and organization, Version 3 of the script not only incorporates username input but also creates a dedicated "Gym" folder on the desktop if it doesn't already exist. The program is then generated and saved within this folder, ensuring easy access and tidy storage of the training plan.

<br>

**Version 4:** 

This version enhances the script from its predecessor by implementing comprehensive error prevention mechanisms. It ensures that input data conforms to specified types and introduces a user-friendly "back" option to correct inaccurate inputs. There are also minor cosmetic changes to improve the experience.
